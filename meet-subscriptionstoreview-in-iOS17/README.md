The emergence of [SubscriptionStoreView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/subscriptionstoreview) frees developers from tedious and complicated code. WWDC23 brought a declarative in-app purchase UI, which allows developers to use Apple's pre-designed app purchase interface. Only a few lines of code need to be inserted into the code to realize functions that previously required a lot of design and code.

In the last few days, I have been researching how to use the in-app subscription function on iOS 17 with clean code, and handle a series of operations including user cancellation and refund in a smart way. This article mainly introduces how the “**SubscriptionStoreView**” brought by WWDC 23 can help developers realize the **in-app subscription** interface with only a few lines of code. A practical example is used to illustrate the specific implementation method and clarify how to support **auto-renewable subscriptions** in your application.
